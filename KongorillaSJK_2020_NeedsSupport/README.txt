This is an iteration of Johann Rocholl's 3D printed linear motion carriage. Johann's original files are for use on 1515 aluminum extrusion. I've rebuilt the mesh in Blender so the carriage can be used on 2020 extrusion. The mesh is higher resolution than the original files, cleaned up, and the preload adjustment screw is on the same side of the extrusion as the mounting plate, leaving the other side of the extrusion free for other uses.

There are two versions available: STLs with support structures built in, and another set without support (so you can use your slicer's generated support if you prefer).

There are also two version of "Side A": one that needs to be mounted on a plate like Side B, and another that has been combined with the mounting plate.
